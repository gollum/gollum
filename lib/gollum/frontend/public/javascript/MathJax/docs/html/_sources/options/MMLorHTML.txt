.. _configure-MMLorHTML:

***********************************
The MMLorHTML configuration options
***********************************

The options below control the operation of the MMLorHTML configuration
file that is run when you include ``"MMLorHTML.js"`` in the `config`
array of your configuration.  They are listed with their default
values.  To set any of these options, include a ``MMLorHTML`` section
in your :meth:`MathJax.Hub.Config()` call.  For example

.. code-block:: javascript

    MathJax.Hub.Config({
      MMLorHTML: {
        prefer: {
	  Opera: "MML"
	}
      }
    });

would set the ``prefer`` option so that Opera browser would prefer
MathML to HTML-CSS output (while leaving the settings for other
browsers unchanged).

Note that if you use the ``MMLorHTML.js`` configuration file, you should
**not** specify an output processor in the `jax` array of your
configuration; `MMLorHTML` will fill that in for you.

.. describe:: prefer: { MSIE: "MML", Firefox: "MML", Opera: "HTML", other: "HTML" }

   This lets you set the preferred renderer on a browser-by-browser
   basis.  You set the browser to either ``"MML"`` or ``"HTML"``
   depending on whether you want to use the `NativeMML` or `HTML-CSS`
   output processor.  Note that although Opera does process some MathML
   natively, its support is not sufficient to handle the more
   complicated output generated by MathJax, so its setting is
   ``"HTML"`` by default.
