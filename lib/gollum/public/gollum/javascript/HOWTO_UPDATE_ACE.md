# How to update the ACE editor component

1. Download a new ACE release from (ajax.org/ace-builds)[https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/releases].
2. Extract the `src-min-noconflict` folder from the archive and rename it to `ace-x.y.z`, where `x.y.z` matches exactly the release version.
3. Replace the version in `app.js` to `x.y.z`.
4. Test if the editor works.
