# Bilbo Baggins

Bilbo Baggins is the protagonist of The Hobbit and also makes a few
appearances in The Lord of the Rings, two of the most well-known of [J. R. R.
Tolkien]'s fantasy writings. The story of The Hobbit featuring Bilbo is also
retold from a different perspective in the Chapter The Quest of Erebor in
Unfinished Tales.

In Tolkien's narrative conceit, in which all the writings of Middle-earth are
'really' translations from the fictitious volume of The Red Book of Westmarch,
Bilbo is the author of The Hobbit and translator of The Silmarillion.
